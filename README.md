## OpenCV rectangle

Get angle from minimum bounding rectangle of text contours.

1. Detect the contours in the image, which includes text
2. Obtain the minimum bounding rectangle based on the contours
3. Retrieve the angle of the bounding rectangle

## EAST model

Get angle from text regions detected by the EAST model.

1. Detect the position of text regions,
2. Retrieve the angle of the region bounding box,
3. Calculate the average tilt angle.

## Projection score

Get angle with the minimum pixel density projection

same like [Radon transform](#radon-transform)
1. Rotate the image at multiple angles
2. Calculate the cumulative sum of pixel values along each row
3. Find the angle with the highest cumulative sum
